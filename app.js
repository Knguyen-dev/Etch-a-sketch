/*
- Create divs using javascript 
- Create a title 
- Create a side panel, with color selectors, so if you click on color mode, then you pick a color with a circular color selector. 
- If you pick rainbow mode the colors will show rainbow colors
- Have a gradient selector, kind of like every 10 pixels, it makes the color either lighter or darker, and it gradually does this for every 5 or 10 grids
- If you pick eraser then it turns the grid pixels white
- If you pick clear the nit clears the board of colors, making everything white
- There's also a slider at the bottom where you should be able to choose how many grids you want
- Then have a copyright at the bottom 

+ Challenge after everything is done, try to make header an interactive grid that the user can hover over and see the different squares and colors
